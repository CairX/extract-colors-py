--------------------------------
Partial support for transparency
--------------------------------
Previously pixel that were fully transparent would be counted towards
black which would skew the result. Now fully transparent pixels will
be ignored and not counted towards the total.

-------------------------
Incorrect command version
-------------------------
When calling extcolors from the command line the reported version
wouldn't match the installed version.
