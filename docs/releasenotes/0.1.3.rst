Conversion stability
--------------------
A reported issue highlighted that there were slight errors in the
conversion from RGB to CIE XYZ and back again. The stability was
increased using higher precision for the conversion. However there are
still slight rounding errors.

--------------
Zero tolerance
--------------
The conversion between color spaced can be bypassed using a tolerance
level of zero. The option can be used to produced absolute color
distribution that has complete stability.
